## Report Interpretation

After running any scan, you'll get a report with:

- **Summary**: Total links found, broken count, success rate
- **Broken Links**: Detailed list with status codes and error messages
- **Link Locations**: Shows which pages contain the broken links

### Sample Report Output
```
# Broken Link Report for https://example.com

## Summary
- Total unique links found: 156
- Broken links: 3
- Success rate: 98.1%

## Broken Links Details

### ‚ùå https://example.com/old-page
- Status: 404
- Error: HTTP error
- Found on pages:
  - https://example.com/blog/post-1
  - https://example.com/about
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Begin with depth 1-2 for initial scans
2. **Regular Checks**: Run weekly scans for active sites
3. **Focus Areas**: Use specific link checking for critical pages
4. **External vs Internal**: Separate internal and external link checks
5. **Timeout Adjustment**: Increase timeout for slower sites
6. **Batch Processing**: The tool automatically handles large link sets

## Integration Ideas

- Run before major site deployments
- Include in CI/CD pipelines
- Schedule regular health checks
- Monitor after content updates
- Verify after theme/plugin changes (WordPress)
